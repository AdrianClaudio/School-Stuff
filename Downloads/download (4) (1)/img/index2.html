Science in the home
Killer Keem majoring in meme
Calls him on the phone
Can I get an interview, Leafy?
But as hes getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, swat team
Came down upon his house
Bang, bang,
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Keem plays the fool again
Grade gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
he tells Keem to stay when the meme has gone away
So he waits behind
Saying 50 times "I must not be so" oh oh oh
But when he turns his back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Swat Team
Came down upon his house
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, 
Made sure that he was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said "We caught a dirty one"
Keemstar stands alone
making response videos ohh oh oh oh
Collosal and Watch your mouth screaming on youtube
Say he must go free (Keemstar must go free)
The community does not agree and they tell him so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving there lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, doxing
Came down upon everyones head
Do do do do do
Bang, Bang, Keemstar
Made sure they were doxed
Wow wow wow oh!
Do do do do do
