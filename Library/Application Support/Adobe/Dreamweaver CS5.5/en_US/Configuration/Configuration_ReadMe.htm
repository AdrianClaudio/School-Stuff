<h2>The Dreamweaver CS5 Configuration Folders</h2>
<p>Many Dreamweaver features are extensions developed in JavaScript and HTML. The Configuration folders contain these extensions. If you customize or extend the Dreamweaver product, you modify these files or add your code source files to one or more of these
 folders. By familiarizing yourself with these folders, you can discover the interface for extensions as well as working examples of each extension type.</p>
<p><i><b class="red">Warning:</b> The files in the Configuration folders make up much of the Dreamweaver product.
<b>Do not modify, delete, or add to these files unless you know how to customize and extend Dreamweaver.</b> Before you attempt to customize Dreamweaver, read
</i><a href="redir.aspx?C=4526c7de69b74c2d8a9798ad458de1e4&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.adobe.com%2fgo%2flearn_dw_extending_en" target="_blank">Extending Dreamweaver</a><i> and
</i><a href="redir.aspx?C=4526c7de69b74c2d8a9798ad458de1e4&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.adobe.com%2fgo%2flearn_dw_api_en" target="_blank">The Dreamweaver API Reference</a><i>.
</i></p>
<p>Some folder names are obvious. For example, Objects are kept in the Objects folder; Behaviors are kept in the Behaviors folder. One folder that does not correspond to a particular extension type is the Shared folder. The Shared folder is the central repository
 for utility functions, classes, and images that are commonly used by all extensions.</p>
<p>Each subsequent installation of Dreamweaver produces another version of the Configuration directory per user. Dreamweaver appends each old Configuration folder with a version number (for example &quot;Configuration-1&quot;, &quot;Configuration-2&quot;, etc.) where the higher the number,
 the newer the folder. The most recent version of the Configuration folder is always called, simply, &quot;Configuration&quot;.</p>
<p>The following Configuration files and folders correspond to how Dreamweaver features are organized:</p>

<p>Each Issue is separated into two files (one .js file and one .htm file) for localization purposes. The HTML file contains the localizable strings that will be presented to the user in the Browser Compatibility Check panel, should the issue be detected. (Issues
 have no user interface in and of themselves, so the body of the Issue HTML file is empty.) The JavaScript file contains the JavaScript code that defines the browsers for which the issue is relevant, that returns the strings from the HTML file, and that detects
 the presence of the issue in the user's document. Do not make changes to this file unless you are proficient in JavaScript and familiar with the Issues API as documented in

 the command, if there is one, and it may also contain localizable strings and references to external JavaScript files (including the .js file of the same name). The JavaScript file contains the JavaScript code that makes the command work; do not make changes
 to this file unless you are proficient in JavaScript.</p>
<p>You may notice that some of the items in the Commands folder have the same names as some of the items in the Objects folder. This is because some objects launch commands. Commands are more flexible than objects, but only objects can appear in the Insert
 panel. By calling a command from an object file, Dreamweaver can get the best of both kinds of extensions.</p>
