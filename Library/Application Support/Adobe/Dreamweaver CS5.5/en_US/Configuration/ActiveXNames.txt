# Common ActiveX Class IDs
#
# This file contains a list of nicknames for common ActiveX classes, as well as their class IDs.
# Each line is of the form "Nickname/clsid:ClassID".
# You can add your own nicknames to the file, and Dreamweaver will show them in the ActiveX Property Inspector.
# Or you can just type new nicknames or class IDs into the ActiveX Property Inspector,
# and they'll get automatically written out to this file.
