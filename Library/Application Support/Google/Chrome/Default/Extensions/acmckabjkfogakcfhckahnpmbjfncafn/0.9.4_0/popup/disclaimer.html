		<h2>Slither Friends Disclaimer</h2></br>
		<p><i>If Slither Friends happens not to load properly and is unusable, just disable it using the setting in the Slither Friends options at the top right of your browser.</i> This will prevent you from having to uninstall the extension and then reinstall it again later as this will most likely be automatically fixed by an update. The problem was likely caused by a major slither.io game update. Due to the nature of how the plugin works some updates to the official game can cause issues with Slither Friends. Why don't we switch to another method you might ask. Well the way we have made the mod is the only legal way to make it as unlike our competitors, we do not host any copyrighted material/code on our servers. Instead Slither Friends dynamically injects our smart Slither Friends code onto the slither.io page as it loads in your browser.</p>
